### Summary of Project
Our project aimed to accurately forecast the demand for Swireâ€™s limited-release products, preventing both out-of-stocks and overproduction, and ensuring optimal production quantities that align with evolving consumer preferences. Achieving this goal will help Swire drive revenue growth and cost savings, expand market reach, and maintain a competitive edge in response to evolving consumer preferences and industry dynamics.

### Solution
We chose to forecast demand using the ARIMA model and historical data from similar products. One of the main challenges was the strong initial influx of sales that Swire experiences. To address this, we based our forecast solely on the initial launch period of the historical products. This approach allowed us to generate projections that closely matched our expectations for the launch. However, we still needed to account for the elapsed time and market changes, so we adjusted our projections based on CAGR and packaging standardizations.

### My Contribution
I was responsible for developing our final model and the projections for the presentation to Swire. Additionally, I merged geographical data with our original dataset using keys provided by Swire and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the geographical components of the dataset.

### The business value of the solution.
The value of our solution hinges on the accuracy of the forecast. The closer our projections are to actual outcomes, the more money Swire can either save or generate.

### Difficulties that my group encountered along the way
We faced several challenges throughout the project. The primary difficulty was estimating demand for products that had not previously existed in the market. Most machine learning methods we tried were unsuccessful due to the lack of historical comparisons, forcing us to find more creative solutions to the problem.

### What I learned in the project
This project was a great learning experience for me. The work was quite different from what I am accustomed to. Overall, I believe I enhanced my skills in working with time-series data and gained unique problem-solving experience. No matter how much experience you have, one thing you cannot replicate is the uniqueness of problems each company faces. Being able to apply my skills to new challenges significantly advanced my creativity.
